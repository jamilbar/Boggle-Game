## Boggle Game

## Overview
This project involves implementing the Boggle game as part of an exercise for the Introduction to Computer Science 67101 course. The goal is to apply programming concepts and practices to create a functioning game using the provided framework and instructions.

## Features
- A 4x4 grid Boggle board with randomly generated letters.
- Players form words by connecting adjacent letters on the board.
- Words must be found within a given time limit.
- The game supports a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of play.
- Scoring is based on the length of the words formed, with duplicate words disallowed.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the `boggle.py` file.
2. Use the mouse to select letters and form words by connecting adjacent letters.
3. Each letter in a word must be connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. You cannot use the same letter cube more than once in a word.
5. Words must be validated against the provided word list (`boggle_dict.txt`).
6. The game ends when the time limit is reached, and the final score and found words are displayed.
