## Boggle Game

## Overview
This project involves implementing the Boggle game as part of an exercise for the Introduction to Computer Science 67101 course. The goal is to apply programming concepts and practices to create a functioning game. This project implemented in Python, which includes a 4x4 randomized letter board where players aim to find as many words as possible within three minutes. The implementation includes efficient word validation against a dictionary, dynamic scoring based on word length, and ensures unique path usage for each word. The game features a user-friendly graphical interface, real-time score updates, and comprehensive end-of-game summaries. This project demonstrates proficiency in algorithmic design, Python programming, and GUI development.

## Features
- A 4x4 grid Boggle board with randomly generated letters.
- Players form words by connecting adjacent letters on the board.
- Words must be found within a given time limit.
- The game supports a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of play.
- Scoring is based on the length of the words formed, with duplicate words disallowed.

## How to Play
1. Use the mouse to select letters and form words by connecting adjacent letters.
2. You can choose letters that are neighbors to the last chosen one.
3. Words must be validated against the provided word list (`boggle_dict.txt`).
4. The game ends when the time limit is reached, and the final score and found words are displayed.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the game repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/jamilbar/Boggle-Game).
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Running the Game
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
- Run the game by executing the `boggle.py` file
